# Text Editor Starter Code

A text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA(progressive web application) criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Description

I had to go in and implement the features of a progressive web application for a text editor application. This involved editing and setting up the webpack config, installing dependencies that will help with the build of the app and PWA and more.
