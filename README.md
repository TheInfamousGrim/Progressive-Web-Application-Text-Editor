# Text Editor Starter Code

A text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA(progressive web application) criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Description

I had to go in and implement the features of a progressive web application for a text editor application. This involved editing and setting up the webpack config, installing dependencies that will help with the build of the app and PWA and more.

### User Story üë§

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

### What did I Learn üè´

There was a lot that I learned.

Specifically:

- More about how the client server folder structure works.
- How to bundle and build applications using Webpack.
- How to use various webpack plugins to help with the build process such as.
- How to make a PWA which can work offline.
- How to use IndexedDB to save data for a PWA.
- How to use service workers to cache content for the application.
